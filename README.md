# Titanic Dataset

<b>Problem Description:</b>
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

<br>
Two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. 
<br>One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.
<p>Train.csv includes the the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
<br>The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

<br>
As the target variable here is "binary" variable, it is a classification type problem and we have used Logistic Regression in order to solve this problem.
<br>
<br>
With Logistic Regression we could acheieve prediction accuracy of 80%.
